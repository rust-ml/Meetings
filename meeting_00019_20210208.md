## Minutes

- Viewpoint of a newcomer coming from Ivano, whos has been working on linfa recently
- Having a particular topic to discuss about every couple of weeks outside of personal projects
    - Are there particular topics that people would take time to come listen to?
        - Implementation of algorithms sort of like university-like lectures 
        - Not necessarily at university-level, more low-key (doesn't need to be impeccable
    - Doesn't necessarily need to be directly Rust-related, but can be machine-learning oriented in general

- Quick updates on Manuel's Rust-RL
    - Mostly been working on Learning Agents
    - Hasn't really had a need for stacked convolution layers so far
    - Small discussion about how training multiple convolutional layers will probably been really slow on CPU-only


## Action Items

- Manuel to post link about Enzyme meeting, may be using that as the basis for his bachelor's thesis

- Put together a plan for a separate meeting next week about trying to improve participation
    - Ivano can probably join, as can Chris M
    - Chris M to reach out to Ricky about scheduling
