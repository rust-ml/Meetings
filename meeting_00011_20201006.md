## Minutes

### Transfer ZuseZ4/datasets to Rust-ML-WG
* Datasets repository to Rust ML Group Repository
* manuel is interested in transfering that over Zuse24 dataset repository  
* talking about having a list of datasets or places to go for Rust data loaders for ML set in the group 
* chrism mentioned that it would be nice to have multiple loaders for the datasets so it is widely availble to people 
  * if it is a specific loader for something we might want to just link to it 

### Rust ML Optimisation 
* jamal is looking into optimisations with FPGAs and GPUs 
    * for a lot of FPGAs with open source we're not there yet 
    * cool project called symbiflow 
        * https://symbiflow.github.io/
        * open source project that is taking that process and make it simplier 
            * standarizing how to deploy to an FPGA 
            * but that's a ways off 
* took a step back and looking at CPU optimizations 
    * RISCV 
        * open source instruction set architecture 
        * https://riscv.org/ 
    * wants to start here, anything beyond FPGAs for this is a no-starter since the environment is too new 
* here he was looking at arrayfire and ndarray a framework for neural networks
    * as they relate to embedded hardware 

### SmartCore 
* chrism looked at the documentation for the code 
  * docs are really good 
  * mostly classical ML algorithms 
      *  bunch of different regressions 
      *  decision trees and random forest 
      *  nearest neighbor 
  *  linfa has one more clustering algorithm 
      *  SmartCore might only have k-means 
*  Have not looked into their model evaluation 
*  it is on arewelearningyet.com!

### arewelearningyet.com updates 
* updated info
* direct links to linfa and smartcore 
    * calling them out specifically as meta-repos for doing ML in Rust 
* we have green on the board! 
    * one category has been updated from red -> yellow 
* we need to have a sort order to the libraries on arewelearningyet.com 
    * talk with anthony on how to get this done 
    * best sorting order 
        * maybe a function of crates.io downloads and last commit? 
* datasets on arewelearningyet.com 
    * another category for those
    * right now there's not enough repositories for adding another category 
* linfa datasets 
    * https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa/tree/master/datasets 
* Talking about how crates.io blocked a publish crate with a github dependency 
    * just chatting about the technical aspects around loading a dataset with a crate 

### Open Source Licensing in Machine Learning 
* looking into licensing, ethics, privacy, and everythign around ML 
* reached out to the group of responsible AI licensesing 
    * not helpful responses from them 
* nearing the end of the first draft of the blog post on licensing around ML
    * overview, in-the-weeds, and a good use case of licenses 
    * description of why he feels using Apache2.0 and MIT is not sufficient for the libraries 
        * the distinct lack of responsibility of the technology that we're not comfortable with in publishing a ML library 
* talked to a lawyer family member 
    * IP lawyer is needed, they said it's magical and very specific 
* considering writing a first version of a license for open source ML libraries 
    * however writing your own license is very very difficult 
* if anyone is interested to help review, reach out
    * he will find a way to send it so we can help out 

### Online Learning Machinery in rust 
* high veloicty machine learning 
* written implemetnation of regession 
    * online learning 
        * most well known tool is Vowpal Wabbit
            * written in C++ 
            * heavily specalized and very fast 
        * however, if you narrowdown the problem and use Rust
            * you can make it 3x faster ;) 
* they wrote an internal tool to make this very fast 
    * trying to open source it, licensing right now though and it's moving along 
* why it is interesting 
    * this is written in Rust that others don't have 
    * probably the fastest linear regression on normal CPUs 
* used internal for data science research 
    * hyperparameter tuning 
    * maxing out at memory bandwidth it's that fast 
* going to move from internal repository to github 
    * so they are forced to maintain it there 
* optmized a lot 
    * like instead of gzip using lz4 
* downside is it's very narrow in what it takes and gives

### Rust ML Meetup November 27th 
* Rust ML WG member talks are listed here: 
    * https://hackmd.io/7hStiyyHQcCCFGVCJb5pfQ 

## Actions

* chrism: talk to anthony about sort order for arewelearningyet.com 
* ricky: Possibly give some time to Andraz during Rust ML meetup talk to talk about the online learning tool they are open sourcing
