# Rust ML WG Meeting 00022

## Meeting Info

Date: 20210331

Start time: 1400ET

Zoom: https://ucsb.zoom.us/j/6601852842

## Agenda

- Updates on `linfa`
    - Several PRs have been merged, a few more are getting underway

- ndarray 0.15 has been released
    - Larger update than from 0.13->0.14
    - linfa currently using 0.13, ongoing PR for updating to 0.14
        - Pros/cons of trying to jump directly to 0.15 before the next major linfa release?

- Rust-ML book is seeing some progress, but still a little slow
    - Most of DBSCAN content, including comparison with KMeans is in draft PR, just needs some polishing

- Manuel: 
    - Looking for an example (gradient generation) for my final thesis.
    - Enzyme: Issues getting tests running
    - Fixing convolution (once again) with chris?

## Participants
- Chris M
- Manuel 
- Lorenz
- Ivano 
- Remi L.
- Jan M.R.

## Minutes

- linfa
    - Partial least square algorithm added
    - An algorithm found on /r/rust wrapped in t-SNE algorithm
    - Updates for KMeans with different initialization techniques (interesting stuff regarding thread-local data storage), for KMeans++ and KMeans parallel

- Manuel and Chris are going to try to finish backwards convolution pass this weekend

- Manuel is moving forward with Enzyme for Rust for his bachelor's thesis
    

- Blocking issue with `sprs` for adding 0.14 to linfa
    - Remi thinks it makes sense to have at least one version of linfa with ndarray 0.14 to minimize possible dependency conflicts
    - Ivano needs 0.14 for scaling as well

- Ivano is continuting work on pre-processing
    - Is working on figuring out a better way to do benchmarks

- Starting `linfa` bindings to Python?
    - Remi is interested
    - Some Rust language constructs don't map 1-to-1, so that would be something to consider
    - Lorenz happy to accept pull requests, but probably won't be actively working on it
    - Remi might give it a shot once the 0.14 PR gets merged
    - Mentioned the Luca wrote an intial Python binding for the first KMeans algorithm

## Actions

- Chris to reach out to book CI PR author, take over if not interestd in continuing
