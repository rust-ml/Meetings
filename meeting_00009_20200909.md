## Agenda

- Rust-RL: Short presentation

- Collect Information about active and advanced ML respositories not represented here on Zulip. 

- Linfa
    - New tests for `trees` in the works
    - linfa-ensemble in the works (starting from random-forest) 
    - Documentation is currently being updated

- There's currently a 'Book' repository, which is private to the Rust-ML group. 
    - Documentation for linfa should be probably take priority, but it would be great if these two could influence each other
    - This seems like a good 'first issue' for people looking to get involved with the group or machine learning in general. Examples with real-life data sets being imported, applied, etc. could be used here
    - This is currently being done in `mdbook` format--considering the popularity of Jupyter in the machine learning domain and the [evcxr](https://github.com/google/evcxr) kernel, should an alternate format be considered?
