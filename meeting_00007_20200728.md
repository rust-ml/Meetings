Start time: 1600 ET

https://ucsb.zoom.us/j/96478383368

Meeting ID: 964 7838 3368

## Agenda
- Progress on Linfa is continuing
    - improve CI with testing (seems to be broken) and code formatting check
    - attract more potential contributors
    - write a Rust ML book, showcasing some existing algorithms
    - how should `features` look like in linfa?
- chrism has started working on a library for parsing the CIFAR-10 binary files and returning an Array4<u8> data and Array2<u8> labels
    - Not for general release yet, but could be useful 
    - https://github.com/quietlychris/cifar-10
    - adding CIFAR-10 examples in `linfa`
- 

## Participants 
- chris m
- Lorenz
- Jed B.
- Patrick B.
- Paul K.
- Tiberio F.


## Minutes
- Discussed use of CIFAR-10 dataset for CNNs
    - chris m's library has made progress, still needs to push commits
- linfa has accepted ~4 pull requests in the last couple weeks
    - decision trees, logistic/linear regressions, common evaluation metrics
- Also need to evaluate the structure of linfa
    - Automated testing
    - Code formatting
    - Adding machine learning showcase book
    - Thinking about using features/feature gates for sub-crates?
    - Machine learning showcase?
    - No additional open pull requests

- Linfa to-dos
    - Removing top-level example of K-means, or adding sub-crate examples to top-level
        - make documentation reflect this

- Consider reorganizing linfa, such that sub-crates are in different repositories, etc. 
    
- Considering making the machine learning showcase Book as a new repository to the rust-ml GH repo
    - https://bytesnake.github.io/mdbook_example/ (see https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bytesnake/bytesnake.github.io/full/rendered/mdbook_example/example.md for source)
    
- Discussed existing autodifferentiation libraries
    - GATs are needed; in the language pipeline, but not in stable at the moment
    - autograd, autograph 
    
- Tiberio discussed his webgpu library
    - Currently supports matrix multiplication, reshaping, broadcasting
    - Still under development, working on it in his free time
    - Synchronous and async interfaces available
    - He's writing a lot of tests, making sure of everything's correctness, then will transition to focusing on speed

## Actions

- Begin working on roadmap to Linfa 0.2 release (see suggestions above)
    - Open issue on GitHub for ongoing conversation
    - Restart CI pipeline, etc. --this needs to be updated, since repostory has changed ownership from Luca to the rust-ml org
