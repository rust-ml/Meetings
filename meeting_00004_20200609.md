## Agenda
- Updates on current projects being worked on by individual contributors
- Discussion on convolutional networks
    - We have several approaches to fully-connected/final layers that are getting decent results on MNIST, but am curious about approahes for moving in RGB space with CIFAR-10, etc. 


## Participants
- Chris M
- Manuel Drehwald

## Minutes
- Introductions
- Manuel has worked on C++ neural networks, curious about porting to Rust
    -  Using `ndarray` as the linear algebra backend at the moment
    - Interest in WebGPU
    - Interested in reinforcement learning
        - Working on relatively small inputs, so ndarray speed isn't a major blocker at the moment
    - Interest in parallelism


## Actions
- Manuel is planning on uploading his project once it's up to alpha on dense layers
