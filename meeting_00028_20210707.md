## Minutes

- Saw neuronika on Reddit]
    - https://github.com/neuronika/neuronika 
    - Working on becoming similar to a Rust version of PyTorch, etc. (in the auto-diff area)

- Daniel is working on Linfa OPTICS algorithm
    - Is getting feedback on a little bit of 
    - Uses hnsw, works to update MSRV to ~1.50
        - Based on supporting const generics
        - Have a conversation with Lorenz about changing the Linfa CI away from the pinned nightly version up to the latest?
            - Yuhan thinks that nightly in the CI might not be necessary at all
    - Has a small lifetime issue, would be grateful is anyone could find some time to take a look
        - Otherwise, seems close to merging

- David has opened an issue on linfa for making pca work with sparse components
    - https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa/issues/143
    - Lorenz suggested taking a look a some parameters in order to judge which particularly type of algorithm use
    - Should be

- David is interested in using a large external dataset to test some code (Yale Face Database B)
    - Asked about including that directly in linfa-datasets
        - Appx. 2GB in size
    - Chris thinks breaking that out into a function for pulling that data in as needed from an external cache would make more sense, rather than directly including it

- Daniel's group is doing speech recognition in Rust
    - Needs to be able to handle at least 1000 voices
    - Using the 
    - One researcher has had some issues with the Kodama/Linfa APIs; will ask them to do a small write-up about what those were
    - Currently using Kaldi, also looking into https://speechbrain.github.io/
