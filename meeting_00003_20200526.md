## Participants

Chris (chrism) 

Ricky (degausser)

Samuel Lim (amadeusine)

## Minutes

### updating arewelearningyet.com 

Talking about how to edit and the status of the arewelearningyet.com
- all members of the working group (on github) have push accesses (to master)
- the CI is up-to-date so all pushes will update the site 

Talking about the github organization membership 
- Everything looks okay, but we should add any other participants to the membership list 

Waiting for a few more members to join 

### What stuff is being worked on/made? 

Still in prototype mode, and understanding what is out there 

let's make a document so we can track this asynchronously 

### GPU compute & linear algebra Roadmap 

arrayfire bindings - computation backend in cogent 
- is this running on GPU? 

gpuarray-rs 
- limit subset of linear algebra on the GPU 
- not active anymore, archive 
- OpenCL 
- chris cloned and tested the repo and it still works on rustc 1.45-nightly 
- would be a great starter to get rid of the `try!` for `?`
- https://github.com/tedsta/gpuarray-rs 

Chris and I feel like we know mostly what is going on, but not enough without all the members of the group to put out an accurate roadmap for this. 

Giving Samuel a brief overview of the WG (they come from other Rust core groups) so bouncing ideas off them for more attendence

Should we have a text meeting instead of Zoom? 

### Are there any repositories that need attention or need for PRs

The ecosystem is kind of all over the place right now, our first goal is to help with this

The rust-ml group does not own (m)any repositories that we plan to use/update yet, but we are looking at the environment to absorb them (where it would make sense)

Some that we are actively working on and would like reviews/PRs to:
- https://github.com/quietlychris/tsuga 
- https://github.com/rust-cv

### Futhark 

Samuel is working on Rust interop with Futhark which is a functional lanaguage that transpiles to OpenCL and OpenGL 

https://futhark-lang.org 

Rust bindings are being worked on for this language: https://github.com/Erk-/genfut 


## Actions

Ricky will try to make a small change in the [git](https://github.com/anowell/are-we-learning-yet) test the CI for arewelearningyet.com 

Ricky will start a document for status and updates on what we're working on and possibly request for help etc. 

Chris plans to walk through more of the code for gpurarray-rs to see how it works and if it is benficial to start updating, they talk to the owner of gpuarray-rs to see if that's an okay thing to do as well 

Next meeting talk to or get a GameDev WG memeber to talk about GPU work they are doing/using 
- pop in the discord group and talk or ask them to attend?
