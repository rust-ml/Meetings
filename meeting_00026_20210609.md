## Agenda

- CI/CD for the Rust-ML Book GH pages site is up (thanks to Lorenz and Fuyang)
    - https://rust-ml.github.io/book/2_intro.html
- Chris M has started to work on logistic regression, hoping to have it up this weekend at some point
    - But he said that last time about ICA so feel free to bug him about it

## Participants

- chris
- manual
- juanjo
- ricky
- lorenz

## Minutes

- CI for Rust ML book was deployed :tada:
- Manual is looking into adding a new flag to `rustc` and hopefully into `cargo` to load LLVM plugins
  - starting with `nightly` first :) 
 - Not going to tweet yet, we want to get a few more alogrithms up  
- No update to talk with Niko yet Ricky will reach out to schedule some time 
- Chris got a two part article published in the gradient around ML licenses 
    - https://thegradient.pub/machine-learning-ethics-and-open-source-licensing/ 
    - https://thegradient.pub/machine-learning-ethics-and-open-source-licensing-2/ 
- Lorenz has a sort-of-working back propigation update in a branch that chris, lorenz, and manual have 
    - being able to debug this process is a huge benefit of rust 
        - doing something smiliar in say PyTorch and getting down in the C++ bindings is very difficult
- 
## Actions

- ricky setup time to chat with Niko, keep it open to the group
