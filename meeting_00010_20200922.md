## Agenda

## Minutes 

### Rust_RL

- added a few algorithms 
- still not totally ready 
- started added documentation 
  - still not done, and it will take a while  
- still need tests, and looking for datasets  
- zulip channel 
  - https://rust-ml.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/237158-Code-Review/topic/Rust_RL 

### Convolutional Matrix Operations 
 
- Chris is having trouble implementing this in code 

### cifar-ten data parser 

- used for downloading and loading cifar-ten in Rust 
- https://crates.io/crates/cifar-ten 

### AI licenses 

- https://www.licenses.ai/ai-licenses 
- implications of open source in regards to machine learning 
    - licenses.ai has two licenses right now, an end user and source code 
    - the source code seems a little too restrictive for open source but seems good for the end product 
- 

### Datasets on arewelearningyet.com 

- Adding easy to download and use datasets
    - sounds like a really good idea, chris is going to look into this 

### linfa

- ensamble and decision trees are coming along 
- random forest 
    - https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa/pull/43

### Linfa advertisements 

- we did talk about promoting linfa once we hit `0.2` in a couple places 
- francesco mentioned we could talk about it on their podcast, which would be amazing! 
    - datascienceathome.com 

### linfa 0.2 

- a few PRs that are a work in progress right now 
- rigously testing things and benchmarking 
- maybe get lorence and paul's input as soon as possible to see if we can push this to release sooner 

## Actions

- TODO: Chris; look into adding a category for Rust datasets for ML 
- look into updating some of the ML blocks on arewelearningyet.com to colors, right now most are red
    - we can probably move some of the linfa to green
