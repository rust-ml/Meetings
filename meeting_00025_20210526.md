## Minutes

- Convolutaion NN implemetnation 
    - performance wasn't as good as expected 
    - chrism started a new implmentation from scratch and has some nice numbers
        - cpu only for now
        - going to analyze it, and hopefully build alexnet 

- Google Summer of Code (gsoc) Enzyme project got accepted 
    - get two gsoc students for the task, so split the work!
    - will keep us updated for the next steps
        - plus the LLVM developer mailing list
    - gsoc has a hard deadline (sometime in August)


- outlook for linfa + update roadmap?
    -  lorenz doesn't have much time 
    -  trying to find direction with linfa 
    -  accepted nearest neighbors pull request 
    -  new issue for improvements? 
        -  boosting random forest 
        -  thinking about opening an issue to track how can we improve the existing algorithms 
    -  possibly clean up the issues in linfa to better organize what is open and pending 

- Aero-Rust Working Group
    - expressed interest in the ML group
    - not super experienced in OSS and/or rust 
    - working on coming up with a consesnsis project 
    - possibly putting an image classifier on a drone would be fun!

- Fun datasets 
    - http://xviewdataset.org/
        - large classification project 
        - first iteration
    - https://xview2.org/ 
        - damage classification 
        - ricky worked on the baseline 
            - https://github.com/DIUx-xView/xView2_baseline
