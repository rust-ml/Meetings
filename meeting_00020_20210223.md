## Agenda

- Introduction for new attendees
- Ricky: increase participation or activities the group does?
- Updates on linfa
- Chris + Manuel have been working bit together on an AlexNet-like convolutional network for CIFAR-10
    - Backporting updates in joint repo to individual frameworks
    - Still double-checking backprop and stacking in convolutional layers
- Description/updates on Enzyme, autodiff on LLVM level


## Participants

- Lorenz
- Andraz Tori
- Billy Moses
- Steven
- Manuel
- Ivano Donadi
- Ricky
- Diljit

## Minutes

- Quick overview of how these meetings work
    - Writing objectives into the agenda and run a description 
- Linfa has been working on documentation updates
    - Chris M is (again) looking to move forward with adding to a Linfa Book
- Potentially expecting a 0.3.1 release in the next two weeks
- Have been working on solving the CIFAR-10 dataset using convolutional layers
- Manuel has been working a bit with Billy on Enzyme
- Enzyme description, has been working with different kinds of memory allocations
    - Are we using BLAS/LAPACK on our existing CNN implementations?
        - ndarray has BLAS/LAPACK support, but preliminary stuff didn't demonstrate initial 
    - ndarray and nalgebra are both linear algebra libraries, although ndarray is more typically used for scientific computation
        - Might not be able to use LLVM differentiation on different backends?
- Any suggestions for how best to distribute time to make Enzyme more useful in Rust?
    - Internal scripting approach vs. hacking on rustc?
        - No plugins currently exist in the rustc compiler (at least on stable)
        - https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/automatic-differentiation-differential-programming-via-llvm/13188/6

- How well does 1400 ET work for everyone?
    - Got better attendance
    - We'll keep meetings every two weeks for one hour, although there is some interest in every week for a shorter amount of time (30 min?)
    
- Steven introduced himself
    - Just getting started coding in Rust, hoping to learn and join and see what he can contribute
    - Background in biophysics

## Actions

- Chat in Zulip and create a survey for pariticpants that has better dates and times, or frequencies for the meetings
- Chris M to touch base with Billy about setting up a Google Calendar event for meetings and/or recurring video meetings for pair programming
- Clean-up linfa roadmap
