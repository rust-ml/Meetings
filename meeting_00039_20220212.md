## Agenda

 - progress Enzyme integration into Rust compiler
 - update of the [rust-ml/book](https://github.com/rust-ml/book)
 - new repository [rust-ml/tsap](https://github.com/rust-ml/tsap) for configuration of complex applications

## Minutes

 - enzyme integration into rust compiler
     - present work at the EnzymeConf23
     - demonstrate a simple example
     - typetrees causing issues at the moment (no complex compound types)
     
 - progress of the rust-ml/book
     - available at https://rust-ml.github.io/book/
     - simplified structure (removed special backend module)
     - anything in vision, image classification, transformers etc. would be interesting
     - chris: linfa in use for image clustering (but not public yet)
     - chris: writing a chapter about pure Rust introduction into machine learning would be interesting
     - classification on cifar10 dataset first target
 - rust-ml/tsap crate
     - copy behaviour of hydra
     - take a look at DVC, for large scale pipelines https://towardsdev.com/ml-pipeline-decoupled-i-managed-to-write-a-framework-agnostic-ml-pipeline-with-dvc-rust-python-287de68104c9
 - GPU support
     - Corey works on wrapper for CUDA toolkit with JIT compilation of cuda kernels https://github.com/coreylowman/cudarc
     - [rust-cuda](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/Rust-CUDA) project has not got updates recently but integration into nalgebra in progress
     - Burn uses torch as GPU backend
     - chris: [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) also supports computation kernels but apparently no collaboration with embark group
     - SPIRT https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/spirt
