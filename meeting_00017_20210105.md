## Minutes

### Rust_RL Supports Double-DQN

- https://github.com/ZuseZ4/Rust_RL/tree/ddqn 
- https://medium.com/@parsa_h_m/deep-reinforcement-learning-dqn-double-dqn-dueling-dqn-noisy-dqn-and-dqn-with-prioritized-551f621a9823 
- use two neural networks to predict a state 

### rust_rl issue 

- first open issue 
- https://github.com/ZuseZ4/Rust_RL/issues/6 

### from the rust_rl issue 

- do we have that `rurel` tracked on arewelearningyet.com?
- https://github.com/milanboers/rurel/ 
    - no, but last activity was August 2019

### New cifar-ten version released

- https://crates.io/crates/cifar-ten 
- added an option to download the compress data (from online mirror)
    - downloads and decompresses automatically 

### tsuga 

- chrism working on hardcoding a convolutional layer with backpropigation 

### GPU 

- any updates on OpenCL or webGPU bindings 
    - https://github.com/JonathanWoollett-Light/gpu_blas 
    - extreme WIP 
- https://jonathanwoollett-light.github.io/blas/ 

### Automatic differenation of GPU Kernels 
- https://github.com/wsmoses/Enzyme 
- some successes! 
    - differenate matrix multiplies and some financial code and got the right anwsers 
- you can `malloc` in a GPU kernel though it is very undocumented 
    - will give thread-level memory 
    - amount of memory per thread isn't equal to total GPU memory/number of threads 
- Rust GPU code 
    - lookingo for good examples :P 

### MPI handling 
- in enzyme 
- (MPI == message passing interface) for distributed computing 

## Actions

- Get a gpu_blas update for next meeting
