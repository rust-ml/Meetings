# Minutes

- Some smaller updates on Linfa
    - Removed reqwest from dependencies 
    - Integrating NN into AppxDbscan

- Looking into using Linfa without BLAS systems libraries
    - ndarray-linalg is, in particular, affected
        - Largely using the Cholesky decomposition
    - Could use nalgebra to provide access to the methods that are currently gatekeeping that switch
        - https://docs.rs/nalgebra/0.3.2/src/nalgebra/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/nalgebra-0.3.2/src/linalg/decompositions.rs.html#264-306
    - Could also create ndarray-based lib, using nalgebra's implementations, to provide those methods
        - Create secondary libary doing this first, then trying to upstream afterwards?
    - Want to use upstream ndarray-linalg traits, which shouldn't create linker error without LAPACK

- Should we think about splitting linfa-clustering into individual crates?
    - Doesn't largely effect the dependency tree, but might affect build times
    - Something similar about Nearest Neighbors

- Yuhan did initial review of the PR for Multinomial Naive Bayes
    - Suggested using traits rather than enums
    - Lorenz is going to take a look as well, especially on the actual algorithm implementation

- Doing benchmarks with linfa-python
    - https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/linfa-python
    - Using PyO3
    - Switching from poetry to maturin per PyO3
    - Get started with KMeans
    - chrism 

# Action Items
- chrism will open issue around adding Python bindings and benchmarks to the linfa repo
- Lorenz to take a look at the Multinomial Naive Bayes PR as well, with a focus on the actual algorithm implementation
