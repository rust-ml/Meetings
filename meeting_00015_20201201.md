## Meeting Info

Date: 20201201

Start time: 1600 ET

Zoom: https://ucsb.zoom.us/j/6601852842 

## Agenda

- Discuss recent London meetup and talks 
- ndarray has been updated to v0.14
- Release of linfa v0.2
    - Lots of new features now available through crates.io instead of just GH master
- ONNX experiments
- oxidize/enzyme

## Participants

- chrism
- Tiberio 
- Ernest
- Lorenz
- Manuel
- diversable (Daniel)

## Minutes

- Lorenz spoke with Luca and transferred ownership of linfa on crates.io to the Rust-ML group
    - version 0.2.1
- Small announcement on Reddit about release on linfa
- Going to speak with Paul re: ElasticNet implementation
- Small issues with the appx_dbscan implementation, so may need to rebase
- Lorenz is working on trees and porting over some tests
- Great attendance at the London Rust community meetup (over 100 people at one point)
     - Highlighting corners of the Rust ecosystem that haven't necessarily been at the forefront (not just web servers)
     - Other talks have been about topics like GameDev
     - Got great feedback about Rust in data science. People didn't really know that this was an area people were using Rust, and Ernest heard a lot of great feedback and interest in the area
     - Quality of the hosting service wasn't great, esp. on audio
- Rust London group is looking to add more talks later this year
    - If interested, reach out to Ernest on Zulip
- diversable has expressed an interest in being able to interface Rust with Julia code
    - Julia has a lot of nice things: Mature-ish ML libraries, GPU support, accessible syntax
    - https://docs.rs/julia/0.2.5/julia/ offers a basic interface between the two
    - Possibly a new way to access consumers of Rust data science libs vs. producers
- ndarray has been updated to 0.14, includes some new features and dependency bump, many more new updates on roadmap for 0.15
- Rust-ML now has a twitter: @rust_ml
    - Good for community outreach
    - Ernest has found Rust interest in community groups in Rust Cambridge and Rust Oxford that may provide an audience that is interested in Rust data science and machine learning
        - Ernest would be happy to provide introductions
- Discussion about Enyzme
    - https://github.com/tiberiusferreira/oxide-enzyme
    - https://github.com/wsmoses/Enzyme
    - There is an issue in the C++ REPL that is still working on being upstreamed
    - Still a lot of hacky stuff needed to get things running
- ONNX
    - CPU-only, but used for creating portable computation graphs between neural network libraries
    - Being portable between different frameworks
    - Currently for inference, support for training is being worked on
    - Can be combined with ML-IR 

## Actions

- Writing Book/examples using linfa 0.2 
- Docs improvements: adding a small example in each sub-crate to linfa to show how to use those algorithms
- Continue experimenting with Enzyme for codegen
- Discuss reaching out to Rust Oxford/Cambridge groups
- If anyone has experience with Rust-Python bindgs, please reach out to Manuel, who is interested in moving forward with writing Python bindings for his Rust-RL project 
- Ernest may reach out with requests for more talks in the future, so anyone with interest can reach out him or keep that in the back of their mind
