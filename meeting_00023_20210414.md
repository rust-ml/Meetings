# Rust ML WG Meeting 00023

## Meeting Info

Date: 20210414

Start time: 1400ET

Zoom: https://ucsb.zoom.us/j/6601852842

## Agenda

- DBSCAN chapter has been added to rust-ml book
    - Starting work on ICA next

- Lorenz and Manuel added oxide-enzyme to the rust-ml Github repository. Highly WIP, but shows how to generate gradients with Enzyme.
    - no type-tree generation for now, but got simple `f(x) = (x^2+1) + 2x` working (with nested functions)
    - provide starting point for Manuel's thesis
    - Give a small showcase?

- Linfa
    - incremental KMeans implemented (@YuhanLiin)
    - ~~almost ready for merging~~ merged: `linfa-preprocessing` by Ivano (@Sauro98)
    - Platt scaling and multi class composing model needs review
    - bump `linfa = 0.4`?

## Participants

- Chris
- Manuel
- Ricky
- ivano
- William
- yuhan
- Lorenz

## Minutes

- Meta
    - Been a few weeks
    - woo good number of people for this meeting! 

- DBSCAN chapter has been added to rust-ml book
    - :tada: 
    - independent component analysis next 
    - should go quicker 

- Lorenz and Manuel added oxide-enzyme to the rust-ml group
    - tried to integrate enzyme into Rust ecosystem 
    - basic prototype with type signature function for a heard start for manuel's thesis 
        - meets with supervisor tomorrow to announce thesis :clap: 
    - Screen sharing 
        - and poking through the code 
    - any pre or post processing optimization? 
        - no not yet 
        - you want all of the pre-optimizations on
            - except vectorization and unrolling 
        - might want to enable post-processing optimizations on 
    
- Linfa
    - yuhan implemented an incremental k-means 
    - ivano merged `linfa-preprocessing` :tada: 
    - lorenz implmented platt scaling and multi-class composing model
        - needs review though 
        - some examples are bad and could use some help digging into where it fails 
    - probably publish next linfa once platt scaling is merged 
        - blocked on the ndarray version with sparse matrix library in the trait system 

- chrism writing licnensing artice for _The Gradient_ 
    - machine learning, ethics, and open source licensing 
    - teneatively accepted for publication (parts 1 & 2)
        - released over the next 2 or 3 weeks :tada: 
    - bio should say rust-ml WG :D so hopefully some exposure there! 

- question on how does the new testing benchmarks for multi-thread/processing applications 
    - not totally sure about this with cache misses etc, but should always take results with a grain-of-salt
    - 

## Action Items

- chrism review the platt scaling MR 
    - https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa/pull/112 
-
