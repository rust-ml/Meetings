## Agenda
- Discuss state of ongoing projects
    - Some work has begun on general convolution library with [asterusk](https://github.com/niniack/asterusk). Disucssion about moving to linfa?
- linfa has been transferred from Luca P. to rust-ml org
- Updates on arewelearningyet (new NLP category)

- Any updates on GPU programming?
    - Not sure if it's been mentioned, but there is some (not optimized) OpenCL code in [carya](https://github.com/quietlychris/carya), but the benchmarking and optimization steps still need to be done against CPU ndarray
        - Seems like benchmarks, etc. are something that could be usefully standardized across linear algebra implementations i.e. tasks with certian operations certain numbers of times that are compared against one another. This could be a good place for the Rust-ML org to step into 


## Participants

- Chrism
- nishant Aswani (niniack)
- ricky (degausser) 
- bytesnake

## Minutes


### state of ongoing projects 

- nishant started [asterusk](https://github.com/niniack/asterusk) 
    - general convolution library 
    - using FFTs 
    - finished up 2D FFT
        - found no mantained crate does this so far 
    - Q: bytesnake FFT is fast for large convultions? 
        - yup! 
    - ChrisM put in a MR for asterusk 
        - for kernel convoultions 
- talking about the [autograd](https://github.com/raskr/rust-autograd) crate 

### Linfa

- Luca transfered over the linfa crate to rust-ml GitHub organization 
    - https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa
    - bytesnake is working on porting some features to linfa now
        - https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa/pull/23
    - many updates coming to linfa in the future 
- documenation/README really needs update 
    - but wait for the MRs to be merged in 
- don't forget to publish a new version of the crate :D 
- should we "move" asterusk to linfa? 
    -  we should make more progess on the kernels convolutions before merging into Linfa
    -  so let it develop for more time before the move is considered 

### Updates on arewelearningyet.com 

- New category to submit crates to NLP!
- still accepting pull requets and it is updated frequently :) 
- going to work with a better front end person for some upates
- exploring the site and talking about any updates 

### Updates on GPU programming 

- Tiberio couldn't make it, but posted an update on his gpu-compute library, [here](https://github.com/tiberiusferreira/gpu_compute)
- [emu](https://github.com/calebwin/emu)

## Actions
- Linfa PR work:
    - Accept PR [#20](https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa/pull/20)
    - Accept PR [#18](https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa/pull/18)
    - Close [#10](https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa/pull/10)
        - since PR 20 has 10's features already included in it
    - update README once PRs have been closed 
- Add asteruk to arewelearningyet.com :) 
- Add finalfrontier to arewelearningyet.com 
- Possibly add a key to the colors of the categories on the main page on arewelearningyet.com 
    - Oh the key is [here](http://www.arewelearningyet.com/about/) link that from the main page more obviously? 
- Update the ordering on the category result page on arewelearningyet.com
    - last commit? 
    - most downloads? 
    - sortable? 
- advertise Linfa on This Week in Rust once PRs are merged 
    - maybe? or annoucnce the group first with some issues and summaries of the group's goal?
    - would be nice to get some more people to help out and see the crate/rust-ml group
