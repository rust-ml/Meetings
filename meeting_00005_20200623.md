## Agenda
- Discuss collaborative library for doing `ndarray`-based convolution
    - Seems like an extremely common use-case that most people would probably otherwise need to re-implement from scratch
    - [`ocl-convolution`](https://github.com/slowli/ocl-convolution) does this with OpenCL-accelerated code, although examples for CPU-only aren't great

- Updates on individual approaches and any new libraries
    - Has anyone looked at the `autograd` crate? It's pretty impressive, although the examples aren't completely working at the moment (bug report has been filed)
